Get notified if you accidentally leave a door or window open. Lock the car if you for instance parked away from your home and it has been parked unlocked. Trigger actions when your car leaves your home or arrives home [1]. You can start the parking heater (if fitted) to come on before you get in the car so itâ€™s nice and warm and the windows are defrosted when you want to depart.
Blink lights and honk the horn of your car if it is parked at home and you want to raise awareness for an event such as a fire or security alarm. 
Verify battery level and start charging (if supported) your car if needed.

[1] Please note that the delay for these events is dependent on how frequently your car pushes updates to the Volvo Cloud.
