Get notified if you accidentially left a door or window open. Lock the car if you for instance parked away from your home and it has been parked unlocked. Trigger actions when your car leaves your home or arrives home [1]. You can start the parking heater (if fitted) to come on before you get in the car so itâ€™s nice and warm and the windows are defrosted when you want to depart. Start the engine remotely (if supported) so you can heat up or cool down the cabin.
Blink lights and honk the horn of your car if it is parked at home and you want to raise awarness for an event such as fire or security alarm. 
Verify battery level and start charging your car if needed.

[1] Please note that the delay for these events are dependent on how frequently your car pushes updates to the Volvo On Call cloud or optionally how frequently you have configured the app to refresh values from your car. Side effect of the latter is power consumption of your 12V battery.

For more information about the app and the possibility to get support please visit the forum link in section below.
